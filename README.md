# lc3

This is a recreation of the LC3 programming language in Python.

## Purpose
The purpose of this is for anyone to be able to run their own interpreter of LC3's assembly language on their computer.
This will let anyone learn how to use it without either having their own LC3 or setting up a complicated interpreter in some other language.

## How to Use
To use, put your code into a file then follow the following step:
- On MacOS: `python3 main.py <file name>`
- On Windows (and Linux): `python main.py <file name>`
